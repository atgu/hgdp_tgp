    "# General Overview\n",
    "The purpose of this script is to merge metadata components needed for the HGDP+1kGP dataset and then apply QC filters on that resulting dataset. The metadata included sample and variant information (e.g. geographic region, and which samples/variants passed QC) that were initially located in different datasets. The QC filters were run using sample and variant flags from the metadata datasets. These flags were generated as a result of the dataset being run through the gnomAD QC pipeline. More information on the gnomAD QC pipeline can be found [here](https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/news/2020-10-gnomad-v3-1-new-content-methods-annotations-and-data-availability/#sample-and-variant-quality-control). To see how these filters were updated as a result of our analyses, see [gnomAD sample filters](#3.-Investigating-gnomAD-sample-filters) and the resulting gnomAD [minor release.](https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/news/2021-10-gnomad-v3-1-2-minor-release/#improvements-to-the-hgdp--1kg-subset-release)\n",
    "\n",
    "**This script contains information on how to**:\n",
    "- Annotate new fields onto a Matrix Table from another Matrix Table or Hail Table\n",
    "- Unflatten a Hail Matrix Table\n",
    "- Harmonize datasets to prevent merge conflicts\n",
    "- Use plots to identify which gnomAD QC filters are removing populations entirely (`fail_n_snp_residual` used as an example)\n",
    "- Retrieve populations being unduly removed by filters (mostly AFR and OCE populations)\n",
    "- Filter Matrix Tables using a field within the Matrix Table\n",
    "- Filter samples using a hardcoded list of samples to remove\n",
    "- Plot certain fields from the Matrix Table:\n",
    "    - Number of SNPs\n",
    "    - Coverage\n",
    "    - Site Frequency \n",
    "    - Freemix\n",
    "    - Number of samples which failed a filter\n",
    "\n",
    "**Datasets merged are**:\n",
    "- sample_meta: sample metadata table which contains harmonized metadata for the HGDP_1kGP dataset\n",
    "- sample_qc_meta: gnomAD v3.1 sample qc metadata from for the hgdp_1kg subset which contains flags to denote which samples failed gnomAD QC filters\n",
    "- dense_mt: densified hgdp_1kg Matrix Table with a field of flags (mt.filters) to denote which variants passed or failed gnomAD qc filters\n",
